My first project at orange coding academy is to create my own portfolio and in it there is sections:
1- header containing my name, position, and CV link.
2- about me
3- education
4- experience
5- contact me
6- projects
7- skills
8- footer with a description, all the links on the page and the location of the academy.

The technology I used in this project HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap5 (navbar only).
